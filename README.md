# Supervised-Deep-Learning-for-Segmentation
Apply fully supervised deep learning to semantic segmentation
- define some transformation functions to preprocess the images in dataset.
- We use Resnet to build our own net and write our own loss function.
- create untrained_net.
- create overfit_net(trained only on one image)
- create trained_net and train it on the full training dataset.
- show the results and differences among these three nets.\
